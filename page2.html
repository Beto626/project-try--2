      <h1>Rose's career</h1>
      <p>Rose was selected with the first overall pick in the 2008
       draft by the Chicago Bulls. Rose became the first Bulls
      draftee to score 10 points or more in his first 10 games
      since Michael Jordan. Rose won Rookie of the Year,  joining
       Michael Jordan (1985) and Elton Brand (2000) as the only
      Bulls to do so. He was also the first number-one draft pick
       since LeBron James to win the award. He averaged 16.8
       points on 47.5% field goal shooting, 6.3 assists (leading
       all rookies) and 3.9 rebounds per game and was also named
       to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.
       <h2>2008-2011 seasons</h2>
       <p>Rose started off his career well with the Bulls. starting his
       second season he got an ankle injury at the beginning of the preseason
       but he was still able to pull through and start the season against
       the Spurs. His ankle was always bothering him but he played through
       and made it to the playoff and lost to the Cavaliers in 5 games.
       Rose was on the rise and according to a report by ESPN he had
       the fourth best selling jersey. He led the bulls to finish
       with a record of 62-20 in the 2010-2011 season. Rose became
       only the third player since the 1972â€“73 NBA season to record
       2,000 points and 600 assists in a single season. The other
       two players were LeBron James and Michael Jordan. He won MVP
       that year and made it to the third round in the playoffs, but ended
       up losing to the Miami Heat who ended up winning it all that
       year.<p>
