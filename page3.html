      <h1>Beginning of Downfall</h1>
      <p>During Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against
        the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose injured his left knee while
        trying to jump. He was immediately helped off the court.
        The injury occurred when the Bulls were leading by 12 points
        with 1:22 left to play. Rose came up just short of a
        triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 9 assists, and
        9 rebounds in 37 minutes of action. An MRI later
        revealed that Rose tore the ACL in his left knee and
        would miss the rest of the playoffs. Rose had surgery
        performed on May 12, 2012, with an estimated recovery
        period of 8â€“12 months.</p>
        <h2>INJURY AFTER INJURY</h2>
        <p>Rose never returned to play in the 2012-2013 season due to
          time needed to recover from his injury. On November 22,
          Rose injured his right knee during a game against the
          Portland Trail Blazers. An MRI the next day confirmed
          that Rose tore his right knee meniscus and that surgery
          was required. At the time, Rose was averaging 15.9
          points and 4.3 assists in 31.1 minutes per game. On November
          25, Rose underwent surgery on the torn meniscus in his right
          knee. The same day, the Bulls announced Rose was out for
          the season, after a successful surgery.</p>
        <p>On February 24, it was announced Rose required another
           round of surgery on his right knee and was ruled out
           indefinitely. An exam and subsequent MRI confirmed a
           medial meniscus tear of the right knee, the same injury
           he sustained on November 22, 2013 against the Portland
           Trail Blazers. On February 27, he was deemed
           a possibility of returning toward the end of the
           season after he underwent successful surgery and
           was ruled out for just four to six weeks.</p>
