      Memphis Tigers under John Calipari, who recruited him after
      seeing him play in an AAU game. He chose Memphis because of

      prospect of Rod Strickland, a 17-year veteran of the league,
     mentoring him. Rose switched to #23, due to the fact that #25
     had been  retired by the school in honor of Penny Hardaway.

     rebounds per game during the regular season and earned  All-
